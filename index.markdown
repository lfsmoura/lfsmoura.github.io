# FAQ

## Who's Leonardo Moura?

## Why do you believe in Web3?

The Internet has brought tremendous power to people. Never before so many people had so much access to so much information. The [Open Web Platform](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform) has empowered individuals to be in control of information and to develop platforms at an unprecedented speed. However, Ill-intentioned companies are running amok creating wallet gardens. Web3 will allow a new era of openess and development for the world, specially undeveloped and unfree countries.

Lord Acton famously said, “Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely”. I believe that the only way we could have a truly free world where individuals are truly free to pursue happiness is by decentralizing all manner of power, including access to information.
