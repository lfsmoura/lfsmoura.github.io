I was born in Porto Alegre, Brazil. I have a bachelor's and a Master's degree in Computer Science from <abbr title="Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul">UFRGS</abbr> (Porto Alegre, Brazil) and in Systems Engineering from <abbr title="École nationale supérieure d'informatique et de mathématiques appliquées de Grenoble">Ensimag</abbr> (Grenoble, France).

At the heart of my career is a commitment to helping users achieve their goals with minimal friction and maximal delight.

I'm mainly focusing on developing governance and infrastructure for [Alliance](https://alliance.xyz/). My background includes developing the Microsoft Search home and query assist technologies, as well with developing HP's Alexa skill and IFTTT integration.
