### Working

I'm working as a software engineer at [Alliance](https://alliance.xyz/), the leading crypto accelerator and founder community. I'm focusing on learning smart contract development and also playing around with text-embeddings.

### Side Project

You can check out my side project, [Crosswords Creator](http://crosswordscreator.com/). Lots of teachers find the site quite useful for creating content for their students.
I am also developing an NFT collection on Base: [Life Collection](https://lifecollection.org/). Early feedback is appreciated.

### Personal Life

I engage in at least one physical activity every day. I swim, go to the gym, and play padel and beach tennis.

### Reading

I am currently reading "A Philosophy of Software Design" by John Ousterhout, and "Hooking Up" by Tom Wolfe.
