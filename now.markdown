## What I'm doing now

### Working

I'm working as a software engineer at [Alliance](https://alliance.xyz/), the leading Web3 accelerator and founder community. I'm focusing on learning web3 technologies at the moment.

### Side project

You can check my side project, [Crosswords Creator](http://crosswordscreator.com/). Lots of teachers find the site pretty useful to create content for their students.
I am also developing a gambling dApp [Block Slots](https://blockslots.xyz/). Early feedback is appreciated.

### Personal life

I swim twice a week and I'm trying to improve my [drawing skills](https://www.behance.net/lfsmoura).

### Reading

I am currently reading Sophie's World for the first time. It's a great introduction to the history of Philosphy.
