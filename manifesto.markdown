## Why Decentralization is the Only Salvation from Authoritarianism

The Internet has brought tremendous power to people. Never before have so many people had so much access to so much information. The [Open Web Platform](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform) has empowered individuals to be in control of information and to develop platforms at an unprecedented speed. However, ill-intentioned companies are running amok, creating walled gardens. Crypto will allow a new era of openness and development for the world, especially undeveloped and unfree countries.

Lord Acton famously said, “Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” I believe the only way to achieve a truly free world, where individuals can genuinely pursue happiness, is by decentralizing all forms of power, including access to information.
