  <h1>Personal Data Sovereignty [Draft]</h1>

  <h2>tl;dr</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Get insights from your data from local AI models</li>
    <li><a href="https://hachyderm.io/@danderson/112766460393943288">Hobbit Software</a></li>
    <li>Open source</li>
    <li>This is a draft document</li>
    <li>Instead of saying water is bad, build damns</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>

  <p>Big tech owns your data and it <a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-should-you-monetize-your-ai-features">sells AI insights back to you</a>.</p>

  <p>Young people today don't know what a folder is. Photos are on Instagram and iCloud, emails on Gmail, notes in Notion. Privacy seems like nobody's concern. My data is scattered all over the internet, and I was okay with it until GenAI came along. I always thought extracting insights from my data was too costly for companies to bother with, but that changed in 2023. Almost every SaaS now has an AI tier, charging you for insights from your own data.</p>

  <p>Most people will ignore this message, but some will start to care about insights. Own your data, privately. Own your insights.</p>

  <p>In the near future, the most valuable resource will be the data that's not on the web. <strong>Don't give away your future wealth</strong>.</p>

  <p>When your data is hostage to big tech, they can compute valuable insights about you. They can either sell you back those insights or sell them to the highest bidder, such as advertisement operators, health insurance companies, the government, or even scammers. This exploitation of personal data highlights a critical issue: the loss of control over your own information. The first goal of this project is to empower people on how to own their data.</p>

  <p>By taking control of your data, you ensure that the valuable insights derived from it remain in your hands and are used for <strong>your benefit</strong>, not <strong>someone else's profit</strong>.</p>

  <p>But I know these platforms provide a lot of benefits. They're convenient, efficient, and cost-effective. My mission goes beyond just education and knowledge-sharing. I want to develop better tools that can give you the same advantages, but with open and free-source solutions. This way, you can enjoy all the conveniences without giving up control over your data.</p>

  <p>This path isn't easy. It takes dedication, innovation, and a collective effort to create a more secure and fair digital environment. But it's a journey worth taking. By reclaiming control over our data, we can build a future where <strong>individuals, not corporations, hold the power</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Awareness</h2>

  <p>The first step to take control of your data is to actually understand what they are. You have identifiable facts about you</p>

  <p>Whenever you interact on the Internet you leave traces of your presence.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Reduce your footprint</h2>

  <p>In security there exists the law of the least knowledge.</p>

  <h2>Step 3: Protect</h2>
