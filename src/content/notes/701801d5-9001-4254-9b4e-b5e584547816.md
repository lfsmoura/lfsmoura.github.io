## Working


I'm working as a software engineer at [Alliance](https://alliance.xyz/), the leading crypto accelerator and founder community.


## Experimenting with voice UI

I'm developing a personal assistant UI controlled by voice.

## Side Projects


You can check out my side project, [Crosswords Creator](http://crosswordsgenerator.com/). Lots of teachers find the site quite useful for creating content for their students.

## Reading


I'm currently reading [Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior](https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5299/Active-InferenceThe-Free-Energy-Principle-in-Mind). Last book I read was [Why Machines Learn](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/446849/why-machines-learn-by-ananthaswamy-anil/9780241586488), from Anil Ananthaswamy.
