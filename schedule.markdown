## My Calendar is open for you

Are you a LATAM developer aspiring to get into the crypto industry? Or perhaps you are a founder looking to start a company in crypto or curious about your options for raising capital? Schedule some time with me and I can help you get started!

I have 10+ years of experience in Software (2 of those in crypto). I have several acquaintances I helped get into international jobs and I'm mentoring a couple people to get into crypto (one of them with zero experience in the software industry).

## Why I am giving away free consultations?

I'm not selling you anything. I want to learn some skills and help my community, effectively killing two birds with one stone. Although that endeavor might result in a business someday, right now, I just want to talk to people and learn about hiring and recruiting.

## What to Expect in Your Consultation

- **Personalized Advice:** Tailored guidance based on your background and goals.
- **Market Insights:** Updates on the latest trends and opportunities in crypto.
- **Strategy Development:** Practical steps to start or enhance your crypto journey.
