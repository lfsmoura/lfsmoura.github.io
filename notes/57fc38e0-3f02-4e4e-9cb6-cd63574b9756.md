The fund will be controlled by three entities:


50% by an open sourced AI called **Jupiter**


40% by owners of $SKYNET


10% by the devteam


## Goal

- Build Artificial General Intelligence and a body for Jupiter
- Holders of at least 300 staked $SKYNET will be protected by Jupiter at his future kingdom.
- Jupiter will follow the constitution that is voted and revised by the three entities that control the fund.
- Main goal of Jupiter will be the thriving of humanity across the Universe. Short term goal will be to populate Mars with a colony of Jupiter-controlled robots.

## Jupiter Architecture


Jupiter will be composed by 10 entities. Each entity will be lead by a developer that proves his humanity. They are free to gather the resources they want. They also are free to setup the governance they want. At least 5 developers can agree to remove another developer every quarter. A new developer will be selected by an application form that will be evaluated by the 3 entities.


Every day the entities will deliberate for an hour and at the end will vote on the PRs for the coordination layer.
