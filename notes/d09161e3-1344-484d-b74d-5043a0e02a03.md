I'm thinking lately about the Web. It's awesome, but it depends on links, and those links are federated; they can become broken links. What if we could link Web documents that may never get lost in the Internet ether?


On IPFS, documents are indexed by their hash. We could do something similar and link pages by their hash hosted on IPFS.


The biggest issue with that approach is lack of ownership, anyone could publish a page and it would be hard to index.


Each page can be an NFT that points to a hash. The document body would contain links that point to other documents.


Here's a rough draft of how links could be defined:


```javascript
1:0x543434fsadf3f43:45(:position-start(:position-end))

<chainId>:<contractAddress>:<tokenID>
```


That may be limited to EVM chains. How could we define `chainId` in a distributed way?
