### Work in Progress proposal


Farcaster has recently released _Frames_. Frames are mini-apps that can be interacted with on the social dApp. When a user "casts" a link that contains a frame on its metadata,   users can interact with the frame even executing transactions. This opens new possibilities for ways of interacting onchain with a much more user friendly experience than currently dApps.


But usage of Frames is still limited to those that are skilled at programming.
