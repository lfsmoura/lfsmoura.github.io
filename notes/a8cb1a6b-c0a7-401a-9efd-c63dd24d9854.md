Have you ever spent hours debugging code only to find yourself back at square one? Our brain is a lousy place to store information. When you are writing code or debugging, **always be writing.**


If you spent the last 30 minutes working and there's no code or writing artifacts produced, **you are doing it wrong.**

- Ran a bunch of tests? Write the results
- Are you investigating a bug? Write every thing you tried. Write down your hypothesis.
- Tried to refactor something and you didn't like the result? Write what you tried and why it hasn't worked.
- Are you trying to understand legacy code? Write documentation, write tests.
