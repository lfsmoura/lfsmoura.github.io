It's heart breaking that most sites from the past are dead. Some of them had a lot of work poured into them. As I was reading [The Bear Manifesto](https://herman.bearblog.dev/manifesto/), I was thinking how hard it is to publish something for posterity.


Is there a services that I can pay to keep my writings up fro 50, 100, 500 years?


If it doesn't exist I want to build it. I think I can learn a lot from cemetery business models. Is there a good book or resource about this?
