I'm thinking lately about the Web. It's awesome. But it depends on links, and those links are federated, they can become broken links. What if we could link documents that may never get lost in the Internet ether?


I was thinking about IPFS and how documents are indexed by their hash. We could do something similar and cite other pages by their hash hosted on IPFS.


The biggest issue with that approach is lack of ownership, anyone could publish a page and it would be hard to index [add other issues].


So I was thinking that each page can be an NFT that points to a hash. The document body would contain links that point to other documents.


Here's a rough draft of how links could be defined:


```javascript
1:0x543434fsadf3f43:45(:position-start(:position-end))

<chainId>:<contractAddress>:<tokenID>
```


That maybe limited to EVM chains? the issue is defining chainId in a distributed way.
