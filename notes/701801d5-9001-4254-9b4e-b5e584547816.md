## Working

I'm working as a software engineer at [Alliance](https://alliance.xyz/), the leading crypto accelerator and founder community. I'm focusing on improving my solidity skills and experimenting with noir.

## Side Project

You can check out my side project, [Crosswords Creator](http://crosswordscreator.com/). Lots of teachers find the site quite useful for creating content for their students.
I am also developing an NFT collection on Base: [Life Collection](https://lifecollection.org/). Early feedback is appreciated.

## Reading

I'm currently reading **Build the Life You Want** by Arthur C. Brooks and Oprah.
