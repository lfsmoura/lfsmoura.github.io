## Working


I'm working as a software engineer at [Alliance](https://alliance.xyz/), the leading crypto accelerator and founder community. I'm focusing on BTC runes.


## Kernel Block 9


I'm exploring peer-to-peer learning at [Kernel block 9](https://www.kernel.community/).


## Side Projects


You can check out my side project, [Crosswords Creator](http://crosswordscreator.com/). Lots of teachers find the site quite useful for creating content for their students.
I am also developing an NFT collection on Base: [Life Collection](https://lifecollection.org/). Early feedback is appreciated.


## Reading


I'm currently reading [Radical Markets ](https://a.co/e1wXsYx)by E. Glen Weyl


Last book I read was **A Philosophy of Software Design** by [John Ousterhout](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/home.php)
