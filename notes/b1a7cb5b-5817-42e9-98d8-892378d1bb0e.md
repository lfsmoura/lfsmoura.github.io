Bitcoin is fungible. But if we squint our eyes and try really hard we can trace each satoshi to the block where it was created. When a transfer is made we just enumerate each input and each output and we pretend that the UTXO on my wallet is composed of enumerated satoshis. This is [Ordinal Theory](https://docs.ordinals.com/).


So we made Bitcoin non-fungible. Ordinal creators came up with **Runes**. That's a protocol for creating fungible tokens on top of Bitcoin. You create runes by structuring your transaction according to [Runes non-spec.](https://docs.ordinals.com/runes/specification.html) So each rune is created at a certain block. We runes are transferred, you can defined on your transaction how those runes are going to be split among UTXOs.


So if we are so inclined, we can also enumerate each rune and assign a number to them. That's the **Runes Ordinal Theory**. We can create fungible tokens on top of Runes protocol. Here's how we can do it:
