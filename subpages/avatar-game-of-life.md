Some time ago I was developing a Game of Life NFT. To decorate the author page I wanted to create an animation that would transform my avatar into a Game of Life.

I've been experimenting with developing with Cursor. So I tried creating it just by prompting. Here's the result:

{::nomarkdown}

<div class="full-bleed">
{% include dist/game-of-leo.html %}
</div>
{:/nomarkdown}

Do you like it?
